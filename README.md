Vance Final Project

**Fitness App**

Our goal is to make a social stay-at-home fitness app where users can track their workout data to compare and compete with friends. By making fitness in isolation a more social activity, it becomes easier to workout at home. 

The main feature allows users to challenge their friends. An example of a challenge may be a competition to do x amount of pushups for the week. This will use friendly competition to encourage the user to pursue fitness goals. The fitness portion of the app will also include workout routines and tutorials on how to do them. The meditation portion of the app will include links on how to meditate and guided meditation as well as tracking meditation time. The nutrition portion of the app will allow users to search up different recipes.
